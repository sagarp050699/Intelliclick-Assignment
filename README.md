### Steps to Add `README.md` to Your Project

1. **Create the `README.md` file**:
   - In your project directory, create a new file named `README.md`.

2. **Add content**:
   - create folders public and src
   - navigate through the folders


3. **Commit changes**:
   - Save the `README.md` file.
   - Add and commit the changes to your Git repository:

     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README file"
     git push
     ```

This `README.md` file provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and using your project, making it easier for others to understand and contribute to it.
